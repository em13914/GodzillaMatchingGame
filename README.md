# GodzillaMatchingGame
An example matching game to teach my students about using and optimizing JavaScript! The goal of this assignment was to help students go deeper with their JS knowledge but also to practice their computational thinking to:
1. Break down the problem and start solving in an inefficient way
2. Thinking about how their solution would scale by engaging with an AI agent
3. Documenting what they learned in a Google Slide presentation
